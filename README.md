# FactorioOneDriveUpdater
Define a list of 'watched' Factorio add-ons and have daily updates which push to your OneDrive (with a handle updating batch script which can be ran through Windows Scheduler for automatic updating). This is through a Node web server which you register your OneDrive credentials with.
